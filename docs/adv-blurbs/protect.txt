Sometimes adventurers only have one job to do: protect the target. The target could be a diplomatic envoy, a bank vault, or a defensive fortification. Rescue also falls under the banner of protection â€“ the only difference is that the adventure starts with the group not protecting the person or thing they are supposed to be protecting.
