Most wars we think of are declared by nations, but they can happen on a smaller scale too. Gangs, families, houses, guilds, companies, and factions might war against each other. A war might be public or private, open or secret. For adventurers, sometimes the mission requires violence, other times it requires a more diplomatic or stealthy approach.
