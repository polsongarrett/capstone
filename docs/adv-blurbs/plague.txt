Plagues can vary in their symptoms, infection method and rate, mortality rate, and how natural/unnatural they are. Adventurers might be challenged in obtaining the cure, or maybe the entire city is too far gone and they need to get out of the quarantined area without getting killed by guards or soldiers. The plague might only affect certain types of humanoids, or only plants or animals.
