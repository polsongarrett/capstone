Conditions occur, naturally or magically, that cause catastrophic disasters in the earth or the atmosphere. Even experienced adventurers will find it difficult to prevent these kinds of events or stop them while in-progress. Sometimes they can interact with the source, such as an angry god, a kraken, or the fact that they stole a sacred relic which unleashed a powerful curse. At other times, the group must simply survive and deal with the aftermath.
